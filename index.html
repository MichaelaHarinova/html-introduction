<p>Funny story</p>
<h5> Well for start I would like to say, that my dear partner calls me "madame nonchalant" which is still quite nice because I'm literally a calamity in some ways. To the story...When I was younger, I had to go for a complete nose surgery because of my congenital malformation of the nose. It was with a few complications when I almost bleed to dead but hey, I'm still here. So like 3 years after making my nose finally functional, I left for a concert and I broke my nose in a mosh pit (well actually one guy accidentally broke it, that happens, better that ribs -right?). So I finished the concert (nothing was more important in that moment) and I left to a doc afterwards so he could brake my nose again to make it straight (also very funny experience btw.) .After cca month, I left for a metal festival. And guess what? I broke my nose again! Now, you might think that it is not funny at all but it was for me. Because everytime I do something nonchalant or as I call it stupid, I'm laughing with it. I was laughing that time and I think it is even more funny now, when I remembered all of it.   </h5>
